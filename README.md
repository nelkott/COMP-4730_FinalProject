This repository contains the source code for a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model for the Google QUEST Q&A Labeling competition on Kaggle.com. In order to test this code, Tensorflow needs to be installed. <br>
- _google_qa.py_ - the source code for our RNN model implementation. Tested by running `python3 google_qa.py`
- _google_qa.ipynb_ - a Jupyter notebook file that contains the outputs and some notes for our model
- _train.csv_ - dataset from the competition page used to train the model
- _test.csv_ - dataset from the competition page used to test the model
- _sample_submission.csv_ - sample submission output provided from the competition page
